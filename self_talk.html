			<p class="blog-post-text">This summer, I started a 30-day challenge of recording myself talking aloud to myself.
			</p>

			<p class="blog-post-text">Why, you might be asking? 
			</p>

			<p class="blog-post-text">There are two main reasons why I started. One was to gain self-awareness. The second was to overcome my insecurity about my voice. 
			</p>

			<p class="blog-post-text">You spend the majority of your day talking to yourself in your head. People often describe their thoughts as ‚Äúa voice in my head‚Äù because, well, that‚Äôs what thoughts are like. Your thoughts are your inner voice. The more you observe them, the more self-aware you become. 
			</p>

			<p class="blog-post-text">In high school, when I had a similar system of recording myself talk as voice practice, I noticed a lot of things about my self-talk that I otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have. For instance, I kept using words such as ‚Äústupid‚Äù or ‚Äúdumb‚Äù to describe myself or my past actions, even though I never used them on friends or family. This ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù moment signaled me to reflect on my lack of self-compassion and work toward positive change, because you can‚Äôt hate yourself into learning or growing from your mistakes. 
			</p>

			<p class="blog-post-text">Speaking of growing, one area I wanted to improve in was my voice. From childhood, I was always labeled as ‚Äúquiet‚Äù and ‚Äúshy‚Äù because of my especially soft voice and my dislike for talking. Truthfully, I wasn‚Äôt actually as meek and submissive as people thought; I just didn‚Äôt like talking. Fast forward to high school, the stress of AP exams and college applications made me curl up into myself even more. When I went days, sometimes weeks, saying as few words as possible to my classmates, that‚Äôs when my voice would get so weak that I felt like I had to shout to be heard by a classmate sitting one foot away from me. 
			</p>

			<p class="blog-post-text">After starting college, I knew something had to change. I can‚Äôt keep living the rest of my life trying to hide and say as little as possible, I thought. Even though I don‚Äôt like how my voice sounds, at least it‚Äôs a voice that works, and everyone has a voice that deserves to be heard. 
			</p>

			<blockquote class="blockquote">
				<p class="quote">I can‚Äôt keep living the rest of my life trying to hide and say as little as possible.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p class="blog-post-text">By recording myself daily, I‚Äôm forcing myself to use my vocal cords (so they don‚Äôt weaken into oblivion), get used to the way I sound, and (hopefully!) strengthen my voice into something louder and more assertive. 
			</p>

			<p class="blog-post-text">Currently, I‚Äôm on Day 4 out of 30. I‚Äôll keep you posted with my progress. üòÅ
