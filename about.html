				<h1 class="blog-post-title">About Me</h1>

        <p class="blog-post-text">Hey there, I'm Kye (they/them). I'm currently a university student studying Cognitive science. This blog is where I write about psychology, books, music, and other topics I'm learning about.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-text">I first started this blog in summer 2024. Bored and restless to do something useful with my free time, I learned how to code websites on freeCodeCamp and read books such as Austin Kleon's <a href="./show_your_work.html" class="link" target="_blank">Show Your Work!</a>, which inspired me to document my learning and progress as a writer, musician, and student.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-text">One of my future goals is going to grad school for psychology. As I am interested in clinical psychology, mental health, I/O, engineering psychology, nutrition sciences, and social welfare, I am currently exploring these topics in school and research settings to narrow down my specialty. Growing up with a family member who lives with depression, I became interested in mental health treatments and policies.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-text">As an undergrad studying Cognitive Science, I am interested in exploring how the brain works, why certain neurological disorders persist, and what treatments provide the best quality care for those in need of mental health aid. </p>

        <p class="blog-post-text">As a Volunteer Crisis Counselor for Crisis Text Line, I learned the basics of reflective listening, collaborative problem solving, and crisis management. Talking with people from all over the world showed me the realities of mental health: so many people are suffering everyday. The experience has motivated me to learn as much as I can about psychology and pursue research as an undergraduate research assistant.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-text">In my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching Netflix, and playing guitar and piano. I first started taking piano lessons when I was around 2 years old, because my older sister was learning piano. Fast forward to now, I've performed Schumann's Piano Concerto in A Minor at Music Fest Perugia in Perugia, Italy. I also have experience teaching piano and music theory young kids. Growing up with classical music, I fell in love with its glistening melodies, hushed tones, and roaring magnificence in the concert hall.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-text">In high school, I joined jazz band, playing tenor saxophone and piano. I fell in love with jazz, how one could simultaneously be the composer and the performer. Performing in big band competitions and small combo gigs challenged me to teach myself. Then, summer after high school, a family friend gifted me a free electric guitar. I always loved listening to Wes Montgomery's gentle chord melodies, so I started learning jazz guitar. Then I joined my university's jazz ensembles and learned a lot from the other skilled players around me.</p>
